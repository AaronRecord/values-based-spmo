# What is it?
A couple of scraper scripts and an Alpaca script to invest in the same positions as the SPMO Momentum ETF, except those not also held by Ensign Peak Investors, so that companies whose values don't generally align with the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (e.g. tobacco, alcohol, gambling, and objectionable entertainment companies) aren't included. The idea is to achieve the high returns of the SPMO ETF, while not investing in companies that are immoral.

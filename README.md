# What is it? ü§î
A couple of scraper scripts and an Alpaca script to invest in the same positions as the SPMO Momentum ETF, except those not also held by Ensign Peak Investors, so that companies whose values don't generally align with the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (e.g. tobacco, alcohol, gambling, and objectionable entertainment companies) aren't included.
<br> <br>
Many values-based ETFs already exist, but most of them offer relatively poor returns. The idea is to achieve the high returns of Invesco's SPMO ETF, while not investing in companies that are immoral (not to say that any company is perfect).

# How to use üîß
Create an Alpaca account (if you haven't already). Create a file named `personal_info.py`, and fill in the information required by `config.py` (`API_KEY`, `SECRET_KEY`, and `EMAIL_ADDRESS`).
<br> <br>
Run `main.py` and follow the prompts. Be aware that "updating your existing holdings" will liquidate all the current positions in the specified account.

I have yet to test this very thoroughly, definitely test this on a paper account before using real money.
